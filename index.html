            My name is Hristijan Stojkovikj, I live in Skopje, Macedonia.I am 20, and i am student
            at <span><a href="https://www.finki.ukim.mk/">faculty of computer science and engineering</a></span>
            in Skopje.I studied high school also in Skopje in school named <span><a href="http://mihajlopupin.mk/">
            СЕТУ "Михајло Пупин"</a></span>.All my life I have been interested in computers and computer engineering.
            I first met a programming in high school and immediately attracted me. I like making web pages, exaxly for my
            prom project I made a website and it went really well
            ,i hope that one day that will be my job.Speaking of high school, in the second year, we were in
            Slovenia attending an <span><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">arduino</a></span> practice in school caled <span>
            <a href="https://www.sckr.si/">"Šolski center Kranj"</a>
        </span>.
            It was quite interesting because we learned the basics of that technology
            and each made his own robot with an arduino plate.When it comes to computers, whether they are laptops or desktops,
            I have always been interested in them and I have always wanted to study them in some way, especially their parts,
            and that is why maybe the hardware has always been a bit more dear to me.But all this interest in computers was not always
            "good" for me, because from the very beginning my friends and relatives asked me to "fix" their computer, whether it was a
            hardware or software problem, so I always pretended I didn't have time :).

            <div id="second-text">
                Besides computers, I am also interested
                and sports, I'm a runner, I run every day and I really enjoy it.
                Apart from running, I also like hiking, cycling and swimming, all my activities are
                available at <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/70248623" target="_blank">strava</a>
                .<br><br>
                Most people will say that the combination of computer and sports is rare, sad but true,
                but it is not a problem for me, I enjoy it.
